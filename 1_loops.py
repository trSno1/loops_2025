# # Example Practice:
# # Given this list of fruits:
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

# # Challenge:
# # Use a for loop to print each fruit on a new line.
# print(fruits[0])
# print(fruits[1])
# print(fruits[2])
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)
# # i just worked with loops

# # Given a list of school subjects:    
# subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History", "Art"]
# for subject in subjects:
#         if subject == "History":
#             break
#         print(subject)

# for index in range*(len(subjects)):
#     print("Subject " + str(index) + ":" + subject[index])

# # Challenge:
# # Use a for loop and range to print each subject along with its index:
# # Example output: "Subject 0: Math"
# numbers = [1,2,3,4]
# total = 0
# for number in numbers:
#      total += number
# print("total:" , total)
# # # Given:
# numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# # Challenge:
# # Use a for loop to add all the numbers and print the total.
new_numbers = list(range(1,6001))
#this creates a list of numbers from 1 to 60
total = 0

for number in new_numbers:
     total += number
     print("Total:", total)
